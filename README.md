# IDLE-One-Dark-Theme
A custom Python IDLE colour theme based off of Atom's One Dark theme.

# Setup
1. Ensure IDLE is closed.
2. Open your file explorer.<br>
3. Go to your `idlerc` directory. On Windows, it's `C:\Users\%username%\.idlerc`.<br>
4. Copy the new `config-highlight.cfg` file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LumiteDubbz/IDLE-One-Dark-Theme/master/config-highlight.cfg).<br>
5. Open IDLE, click on "Options" at the top of the window, click "Configure IDLE", open the "Highlighting" tab, choose "a Custom theme" and click on "Atom One Dark."
6. Apply and exit.
7. Enjoy.

# Footnote
Some colours are not perfect, this is because IDLE's customisation menus are not the most extensive. Nothing I can do about it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
